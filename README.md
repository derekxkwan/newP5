# newP5js

super-simple (and simplistic) p5js project creator (mostly for my own uses because I'm lazy)

- basically a bash script and some templates copied over
- need to make `newp5js` executable

## USAGE
`./newp5js <project name>`

## NOTES
- assumes `newp5js` is in a folder with a lib folder with `p5.min.js` in it (not provided)
- run script from folder `newp5js` is in and run localhost server from same location
